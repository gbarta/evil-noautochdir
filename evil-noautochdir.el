;;; Commentary:

;; This plugin provides an Evil implementation of the default Vim directory
;; behaviour, "set noautochdir". It only affects Evil ex commands while other
;; emacs functionality remains unaffected. It provides :pwd and :cd commands
;; to control the current directory.

;;; Code:

(defvar evil-cwd default-directory
  "Current working directory for issuing ex commands.")

(defmacro with-evil-cwd (&rest body)
  `(let ((default-directory evil-cwd))
     (progn ,@body)))

(defadvice evil-ex (around evil-ex-noautochdir () activate)
  (with-evil-cwd
   ;; This depends on subtle and surprising behaviour which
   ;; happens to work out exactly as we would like due to
   ;; dynamic scoping and buffer-local variables, but probably
   ;; only due to an implementation detail.
   ;; By overriding default-directory with a scoped variable,
   ;; all of the evil and minibuffer and completion code will
   ;; get the directory we have set to emulate noautochdir.
   ;; However, if emacs sets the variable e.g. as part of
   ;; find-file, it will change the real buffer-local value
   ;; and not this temporary value, keeping normal emacs
   ;; behaviour of default-directory!
